ansible-cron
============

Tool to run ansible on repo update

Why?
=====

0. Automatically run ansible on commit to git repo
0. Monitor atomated run status: when it was last run and what was last status
0. Current Ansible pull aproach was found as not handy - it needs ansible install and playbooks checkout on every node
